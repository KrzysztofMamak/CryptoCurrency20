CryptoCurrency app

Application which shows the latest data on the cryptocurrency exchange. Application has also a graph which shows data from the latest 30 days and allows you to save current data in the database on the server(I used MySQL for creating database and PHP to cooperate with this database).

External libraries used in this application:
-Retrofit  
-Glide  
-Graph libraries  

In the future i will:  
-fix the RecyclerView(when the user scrolls to the last position, the recyclerview is not set to the first position)  
-improve the graph representation  
-add animations  
-optimize application for tablets and landscape view  
-change PriceBTC representation format  
-use retrofit library for uploading data on the server  
-add SQLite database  
-add notifications  
-improve general appearance of the application
